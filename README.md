# Data Analysis Internship Project  
This repository showcases the work I completed during the **Excelerate Data Analysis Associate Internship**, where I served as the Team Lead.  

## Project Overview  
Over 4 weeks, I worked with my team to clean data, analyze it, and create an interactive dashboard using Looker Studio.  

### Key Deliverables:  
- **Week 1**: Cleaned dataset and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) report.  
- **Week 2**: Dataset preprocessing and dashboard wireframe.  
- **Week 3**: Built the first iteration of the dashboard.  
- **Week 4**: Finalized and presented the interactive dashboard.
